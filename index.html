        </table>
        <p>I'm a 21 year old web designer and developer working out of eastern Massachusetts. I have been coding websites ever since sophomore year of high school in my first web design class. Fast-forward a few years later I was landing freelance projects most of my junior and senior years. During this time I was also working part-time at Best Buy's Geek Squad division.<br>

		<br>After graduating High School in summer 2009 I started writing on various web design blogs along with launching my own startup ideas. A few months later in September 2009 I spent a couple months studying at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachsuetts. However I left in January 2010 to pursue a career on my own. I now work doing freelance writing and building side-projects in my spare time.</p>
